#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Q1.Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
 -Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications.
 Importance:
 1.Building Reliable and Scalable Systems:-Ensures software is reliable and can scale with business growth.
 2.Efficient Resource Management:-Optimizes development time and costs.
 3.Quality Assurance:-Produces high-quality software that meets user needs.
 4.Managing Complexity:-Handles the complexity of large, intricate systems.
 5.Driving Innovation:-Facilitates rapid development and innovation.
 6.Ensuring Security and Compliance:-Builds secure software and ensures regulatory compliance.
 7.Supporting Collaboration:-Promotes teamwork and effective collaboration.

Q2.Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
 1.Structured Programming: Structured programming emerged in the early 1960s and has been a major evolution of readable code throughout history.

 2.The Agile Manifesto (2001)—#4: You are not delivering a customer need if you're following the rules.

 3.DevOps:01 Integrated development and operations that promote communication and collaboration between the teams to streamline cycle time. 2010s


Q3.List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
 1.Requirement Analysis: To gather and analyze the needs of users.

 2.Design: Premature of software architecture.

 3.Implementation: You write the code, you compile it.

 4.Test: Validating that software functions as expected

 5.Deploy: Release the software live.

 6.Maintenance — post release, to update and fix the software.

Q4.Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
 Waterfall:
  -You have the sequential design process in which each phase needs to be completed before moving onto the next.

 -Use case: Great for projects where requirements are well-defined and not expected to change (e.g. construction software).

 Agile:
  -Adapting to changes in the meantime and customer feedback.
  -Use case: Best for projects that are subject to change in scope (e.g.,  mobile app development).

Q5.Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
 1.Software Developer: Codes, Creates new features and bugs fixes.

 2.Quality Engineer - is responsible for analyzing, designing and executing the test cases as well.

 3.Project Manager - Manages the development, ensures it will happen on time within budget and requirement

Q6.Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
 IDEs:
 Benefits: 
 -Works to streamline coding by providing developers with tools such as code editors, debuggers and build automation.
 For example, Visual Studio Code; IntelliJ IDEA

 VCS:
 Functionality : 
 -Change traking, Collboration enabled; no code conflict.
 Examples: Git, Subversion.

Q7.What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
 Challenges:
 1.Deadlines :-Break tasks into bite-sized sprints with Agile.
 2.Fix Bug :-Full test coverage & peer code review
 3.Staying on top of the technology: Further learning, with online courses & tech communities.

Q8.Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
 1.Unit Testing: verifies the accuracy of individual components.
 2.Increase Testing: Integration tests ensure different components work together.
 3.FSystem Testing: Makes sure the entire system works together.
 4.Acceptance Testing: Verifying Software is meeting the user requirement.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
Q1.Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
 -Prompt Engineering: The art of crafting inputs prompts to get the desired outputs from AI models.
 
 Importance:
 Effective prompts lead to accurate and relevant responses from AI, making interactions more efficient and 
 productive.

Q2.Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
 Vague Prompt:
 -“Tell me about something.”
 Improved Prompt:
 -“Explain the importance of renewable energy in reducing carbon emissions.”
 Explanation:
 -The improved prompt is specific, directing the AI to provide relevant information, which results in 
 a more useful and targeted response.
